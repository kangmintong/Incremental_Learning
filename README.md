# Incremental Learning
Incremental learning is a method of machine learning in which input data is continuously used to extend the existing model's knowledge i.e. to further train the model. Recent applications of incremental learning involve classification and semantic segmentation. 
In the repository, several efficient class-incremental learning algorithms (lwf, icarl, lucir, podnet) are implemented in a simple framework.
